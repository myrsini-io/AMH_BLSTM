Automatic Melodic Harmonization fromSymbolic Melody Using BLSTM Networks

Producing chord progressions from a melody is a challenging task for multiple reasons but mainly because harmonic subtleties are difficult to describe computationally. In this work, we will address the problem of automatic melodic harmonization and we will attempt to provide a proof of concept of generating chord progressions using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) networks from symbolic melodies. A dataset of lead sheets of various music genres will be used to extract meaningful melodic and harmonic information. To achieve uniformity of data, each track of the dataset will be transposed to either C major or C minor according to its initial key signature, while time signature will be normalized to avoid the imbalance of note durations. The result of the extraction will compose two-dimensional arrays consisting of twelve-note classes representing single notes in a sequence of four bars. After the pre-processing of data, the BLSTM network will be trained to generate chord progression vectors of four bars as output. Finally, a quantitative evaluation will take place where the model will be compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms to observe their performance.
